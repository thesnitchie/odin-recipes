          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <h3>Making the Dough:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Combine the mozzarella and cream cheese in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds at a time until the cheese is melted enough to mix together.</li>
            <li>Once the cheeses are melted and combine, mix in the almond flour, egg, erythritol, baking pwder and vanilla extract. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated and have formed a dough.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper and then refrigerate for 15 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Making the Filling:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>While the dough is chilling, combine the melted butter and the extracts together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Brush the butter mixture over the dough, leaving about a 1 in gap around the edges of the dough.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the brown sugar erythritol, cinnamon, and pecans over top.</li>
            <li>Using the parchment paper to help roll the dough, carefully roll it tight, and cut off and discard the uneven edges.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 8 even rolls. (It may help to wet the knife to keep the dough from sticking to it as you slice the rolls.)</li>
            <li>Place the rolls snuggly into the baking pan, but not too tight as they need room to expand while cooking.</li>
            <li>Brush with any remaining maple butter and loosely cover the pan with parchment paper. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until you can stick a toothpick in the center and have it come out clean.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Making the Glaze:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>While the cinnamon rolls are baking, prepare the glaze. Add the heavy cream, erythritol, vanilla extract, maple extract, and salt to a small bowl and whisk to combine. You can also whip this with an electric mixer to make it a thicker glaze that you can pipe over top of the cinnamon rolls.</li>
              <li>Once the cinnamon rolls have finished baking, allow them to cool for 5 minutes and then drizzle the glaze over top.</li>
            </ol>
